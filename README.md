# MC Stacker Improvements
This Firefox extension modifies the interface for MCStacker.net to make it more accessible, making the fields and text larger and making pages display properly on narrow screens.

It also allows the Clipboard, Import and Command windows to go transparent for easier reading (they can be "stickied" by clicking on them). It also implements a browser-side clipboard using Javascript local storage.

It also upgrades the appearance of the "NPC Creator" and "Mural Creator", as well as the "Weaponised Creeper Wars" info page.
